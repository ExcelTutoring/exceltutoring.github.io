			<div col-md-6>
				<p>Hi I'm Davina! I'm currently a student at Imperial College London, in my 3rd year studying Biochemistry. My academic track record so far has always been of a high standard, and I'm currently predicted to receive a 1st for my degree.</p>
			</div>
			<div col-md-6>
				<p>I've had a lot of experience tutoring both informally and formally, as well as experience in childcare settings, and have always received positive feedback from students who have both benefited and enjoyed my tutoring. I hope I can be of help to you too!</p>

<!-- Experience -->

		<h2 class="subheading">Experience</h2>
			<p>Currently I tutor students one-to-one to sit the 11+ exams. Having sat and passed the 11+ exams myself, I have a full understanding of the skills and technique required to succeed. I also have KS3 and GCSE l bevel students, who I have managed to advance from E grades to As.
			<p>In the past I have been a tutor at Explore Learning where I tutored up to 6 students simultaneously, varying in age from 4 to 16. There I also received training and experience tutoring students to sit 11+ exams for entry to selective grammar schools. At Explore Learning I also had the opportunity to tutor students with special educational needs (SEN).</p>
			<p>In the past I have mentored AS Biology students and also regularly volunteered to teach children with SENs to read at  schools such as West Lea School, Edmonton.</p>
